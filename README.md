# SpliceGPT
A ChatGPT powered Discord bot that behaves like a specified user. Requires a csv of chat logs from a channel that the user has chatted in (the more they have spoken in the chat, the more accurate of a impersonation).

To get a csv of the chat logs, I reccommend using Discrub https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/discrub/plhdclenpaecffbcefjmpkkbdpkmhhbj
You will likely have to manually edit the contents of the csv to include only the user names and what they said. You will also likely need to trim the amount of messages it includes to fit the chatGPT token limit. I currently don't have a solution to the token limit.
